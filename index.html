        Hi, my name's <a href="https://github.com/mattcen">Matt</a>.
        I'm a Linux systems administrator, scout leader, open source
        enthusiast (perhaps activist is more appropriate), and geek.
        Other than that, I'm just this guy, you know? As at October 2014
        I'm volunteering as part of the <a
          href="http://www.scientistsinschools.edu.au/ICT/">ICT in
          Schools</a> program in Melbourne, Australia. Their site has
        all the gory details of the program, but the elevator summary is
        that it aims to create long-term partnerships between school
        teachers and ICT professionals so that the professionals can
        help to teach meaningful, real-world content to students and get
        them excited about the industry, to give them enough information
        to decide whether it's where they want to take their career.
        </p>
        <p>
        Since late August 2014 I've been working with a K-12 girls'
        school. The students all have iPads, which have a tendency to
        make it difficult to teach the inner-working of computers since
        they're geared more to consumption of software etc., rather than
        its creation. Nonetheless, my teacher contact has started by
        teaching basic programming techniques using apps like <a
          href="http://lightbot.com/flash-lite.html">Light Bot</a>, and
        we're moving towards teaching some basic programming on
        Raspberry Pis as of October 2014.
        </p>
        <p>
        So, back to the question "What is this?" This site is where I
        intend to host any teaching content we create so that other
        schools everywhere can make use of it. It makes sense to include
        content on how to help get (and keep) girls in the tech
        industry, given this is an ongoing struggle, however I have very
        little experience with what's required to make this happen, so
        any input would be extremely valuable!
        </p>
        <p>
        To start with, I've got 3 really simple Python scripts I was
        going to introduce the students too, but haven't had a chance to
        do so. <a href="python.html">The scripts are here</a>.
